                        <h1 className='mt-5'>On These Truths We Stand</h1>

                        <h2 className='mt-5'>The Scriptures</h2>
                        <p className='subhead'>We believe the sixty-six books of the Bible to be the infallible, written Word of God, verbally inspired by the Holy Spirit, inerrant in the original manuscripts, and the only and final authority in all matters of faith and conduct.</p>
                        
                        <h2 className='mt-5'>The Godhead</h2>
                        <p className='subhead'>We believe in One God, creator and sustainer of the universe, who is eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</p>
                        
                        
                        <h2 className='mt-5'>The Person and Work of Christ</h2>
                        <h3 className='mt-5'>1. Birth</h3>
                        <p className='subhead'>We believe that Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of God, that He was conceived by the Holy Spirit and became incarnate through the virgin birth, and that He unites forever in His person perfect deity and true humanity.</p>
                        
                        <h3 className='mt-5'>2. Atonement</h3>
                        <p className='subhead'>We believe that Jesus Christ lived a sinless life, that He was crucified as the substitutionary sacrifice for the sins of all men, that He rose bodily from the dead, that He ascended into heaven where He is now exalted at the right hand of the Father, and where He intercedes for the believer.</p>
                        
                        <h2 className='mt-5'>The Person and Work of the Holy Spirit</h2>
                        <p className='subhead'>We believe that the Holy Spirit is Himself God; that He glorifies the Lord Jesus Christ; that He was sent to convict the world of sin, righteousness and judgment; that He regenerates and indwells the believer; that He seals the believer unto the day of redemption; and that He imparts gifts to each believer as He wills for the edification of the church.</p>
                        
                        <h2 className='mt-5'>Total Depravity of Man</h2>
                        <p className='subhead'>We believe that man was created in the image and likeness of God, but that as a result of Adam's sin the race fell, inheriting a sinful nature and becoming alienated from God; and that man is totally depraved and of himself totally unable to remedy his lost condition.</p>
                        
                        <h2 className='mt-5'>Salvation</h2>
                        <p className='subhead'>We believe that all who by grace through faith receive Jesus Christ are born again of the Holy Spirit, and are therefore children of God and eternally saved, and that the Holy Spirit indwells every believer to enlighten, guide and enable him in life and service.</p>
                        
                        <h2 className='mt-5'>The Return of Christ</h2>
                        <p className='subhead'>We believe in the ” Blessed Hope,” the pre-tribulation rapture of the church, the personal and pre-millennium second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ to the earth with all His saints.</p>
                        
                        <h2 className='mt-5'>The Eternal State</h2>
                        <p className='subhead'>We believe in the bodily resurrection of believers and unbelievers, the saved being raised unto eternal life and the unbelievers unto everlasting punishment.</p>
                        
                        <h2 className='mt-5'>The Church</h2>
                        <p className='subhead'>We believe that the church, which is the body of Christ, is a spiritual organism made up of all born again persons of this age and that the establishment and continuance of local churches is clearly taught in the New Testament.</p>
                        
                        <h2 className='mt-5'>Baptism and The Lord's Supper</h2>
                        <p className='subhead'>We believe in water baptism by immersion for believers. We also believe that God has given two ordinances to the church, Baptism and the Lord's Supper.</p>
                        
                        <h2 className='mt-5'>Gifts of the Spirit</h2>
                        <p className='subhead'>We believe that God gives spiritual gifts to all believers for the building up of the body of Christ. We believe that God answers the prayers of His people and meets their needs according to his purpose.</p>
                        
                        <h2 className='mt-5'>Satan</h2>
                        <p className='subhead'>We believe that Satan is an angelic personality who fell and became the archenemy of God and man; that Jesus Christ in His death and resurrection defeated Satan; and that he finally will be cast into the lake of fire.</p>
                        
                        <h2 className='mt-5'>Unscriptural Associations</h2>
                        <p className='subhead'>We believe that Scripture prohibits the joining together in spiritual matters of believers with unbelievers or without those not adhering to scriptural doctrine or practice.</p>
